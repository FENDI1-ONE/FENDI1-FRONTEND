            <h2>Terms and Conditions (T&C)</h2>
            <p><strong>1. Scope</strong><br>
These Terms and Conditions (T&C) apply to all orders placed via the online store FENDI1 MERCH SHOP (hereinafter referred to as "we" or "us"). By placing an order, the customer acknowledges and agrees to these T&C.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>2. Contract Partner</strong><br>
The contract is concluded with FENDI1 / Julian Hernes, Wyfeld 19, 47665 Sonsbeck, kontakt.fendi1@outlook.de.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>3. Offer and Conclusion of Contract</strong><br>
The presentation of products on the online shop constitutes an invitation to submit an offer, not a binding offer. By placing an order, the customer submits a binding offer to purchase. The contract is concluded when we accept the customer's offer by either sending an order confirmation or dispatching the goods.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>4. Prices and Payment Terms</strong><br>
All prices are final prices, including the statutory value-added tax (VAT) and even including shipping costs. The payment is due immediately after the order is placed by our payment methods.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>5. Delivery</strong><br>
Orders are produced and shipped by our third-party partners, Gelato & Printful. The estimated delivery time is 3-9 business days. We are not responsible for any delays in delivery caused by Gelato, Printful or other third-party providers.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>6. Right of Withdrawal (for non-personalized products only)</strong><br>
Under EU law, you have the right to cancel your purchase within 14 days without giving any reason. However, this right does not apply to personalized or custom-designed products.<br>
The right of withdrawal is only applicable to standard products (e.g., stickers). For custom-designed or personalized products (e.g., t-shirts, hoodies), the right of withdrawal is excluded, unless the product is defective or not as described.<br>
The withdrawal period is 14 days from the day you, or a third party nominated by you, takes possession of the goods.<br>
To exercise your right of withdrawal, please send us an unequivocal statement (e.g., a letter or email) to kontakt.fendi1@outlook.de.<br>
    You may use the withdrawal form, which is available <a href="/withdrawal-form.fendi1MERCHSHOP.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="legal-link">
    here</a>, but it is not mandatory.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>7. Warranty and Liability</strong><br>
The statutory warranty rights apply. In the case of defective goods, the customer has the right to request a replacement, a price reduction, or cancellation of the contract.<br>
Liability is limited to the statutory extent.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>8. Shipping Address Handling</strong><br>
The shipping address used for order fulfillment is automatically taken from the information transmitted by the selected payment provider.<br>
The customer is responsible for ensuring that these details are correct and up to date.<br>
The seller is not liable for delays or failed deliveries resulting from incorrect or outdated address information provided by the customer through the payment provider.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>9. Data Protection</strong><br>
Your personal data will be used exclusively for the processing of your order, delivery of products, and communication with you (e.g., order confirmation, shipping notifications).<br>
We pass your data to Gelato & Printful for the production and shipping of the products. Gelato & Printful process your data according to their own privacy policy.<br>
For more information on how we process your data, please refer to our Privacy Policy.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>10. Jurisdiction</strong><br>
The law of the Federal Republic of Germany applies. For contracts with merchants or consumers residing abroad, the jurisdiction is Sonsbeck (Germany).<br><br></p>
            
<p><strong>11. Final Provisions</strong><br>
If any provision of these T&C is or becomes invalid, the validity of the remaining provisions remains unaffected. In such a case, the invalid provision shall be replaced by the applicable statutory regulation.<br><br></p>
